# SvelteKit Template

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte) and [mdsvex](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX/tree/master/packages/site/src/components).

## Using the Template

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats! ðŸŽ‰

Within GitHub, click on the **Use this Template** button.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
